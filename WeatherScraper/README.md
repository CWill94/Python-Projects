Project:
This program allows a user to find the temperatures from a given city using the website, https://www.zip-codes.com/. The program
will scrape the website for the Zip Codes in the city and individually google search the temperature of all Zip Codes. Once this is done,
it will graph the temperatures on a map using longitude and latitude. (Currently being built for just Los Angeles)

Prerequisites:
Below are a list of modules you will need alongside the files in the repository.
